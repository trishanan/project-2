Description of project

The aim of this project is to visualize how the "sat scores" varies across different schools so that we can know how much the school is better and also how the "sat scores" varies across different genders,race etc.The project contains a number of datasets which included information about the students and i had to merge all the datasets on a unique ID of each student named "DBN".

I analyzed the dataset and answered a few questions:
1) How is enrollment affecting the "sat_scores"? If the enrollment is high should we expect a higher score or lower?
2) How the survey of parents,teachers and students vary with the sat_scores?
3) Are there any racial biasedness for "sat" exam takers i.e. if a particular race always perform better than the other ones?
4) Is the "sat_exam" biased towards immigrants like the hispanic?
5) Is the "sat" exam gender based i.e. if the females score better than the males or vice-versa?
6) How effective is the "AP" exam also known as the "Advance placement" exam.Does it help students perform on their sat's better?
